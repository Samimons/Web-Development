<!-- The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).

Note: You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. -->

  <!-- The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
    
    Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    
    Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
    
    The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
    
    <title> (required in every HTML document)
    <style>
    <base>
    <link>
    <meta>
    <script>
    <noscript> -->
  <head>

    <!--  -->
    <!-- All modern computer languages use the UTF-8 character set as default. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
    
    <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
    
    Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
    
    Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services. -->

    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
    
    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. -->

    <!-- The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
    
    The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.

    <!-- The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script (JavaScript).
    
    The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
    
    Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content. -->
