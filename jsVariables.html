    <h1>Variables</h1>

  <body>
    <h2>Declaring a variable</h2>
    <p>
      To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we
      call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword let
      followed by the name you want to call your variable:
    </p>
    <p class="code">let myName;</p>
    <p class="code">let myAge;</p>
    <h2>Initializing a variable</h2>
    <p>
      Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You
      do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=),
      followed by the value you want to give it. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="code">myName = "Chris";</p>
    <p class="code">myAge = 37;</p>

    <h2>Declare and intitialise a variable together</h2>
    <p class="code">let myDog = "Rover";</p>

    <p class="note">
      <b>Note:</b> We say variables contain values. This is an important
      distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are
      containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard
      boxes that you can store things in.
    </p>
    <h2>Updating a variable</h2>
    <p>
      Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or
      update) that value by giving it a different value.
    </p>
    <p class="code">myName = "Bob";</p>
    <p class="code">myAge = 40;</p>
    <h2>Variable naming rules</h2>
    <p>
      The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique
      identifiers) are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
      <li>Names must begin with a letter.</li>
      <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).</li>
      <li>
        Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in
        certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific things, so may get
        confusing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and
        causes an error.
      </li>
      <li>
        A safe convention to stick to is lower camel case, where you stick
        together multiple words, using lower case for the whole first word and
        then capitalize subsequent words
      </li>
      <li>
        Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain.
        Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big long phrases.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Variable Types</h2>
    <h4>Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      Whole numbers can be stored in variables (integers), as well as decimal
      numbers like 3.314 (floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to
      declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming
      languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include
      quotes:
    </p>
    <p class="code">let myAge = 17;</p>
    <h4>Strings</h4>
    <p>
      Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you
      need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript
      tries to interpret it as another variable name.
    </p>
    <p class="code">let myName = "Michael Stokes";</p>
    <h4>Booleans</h4>
    <p>
      Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, true or false.
      These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as
      appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:
    </p>
    <p class="code">let iAmAlive = true;</p>
    <p>Whereas in reality it would be used more like this:</p>
    <p class="code">let test = 3 < 6;</p>

    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>
      An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in
      square brackets and separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p class="code">let myNameArray = ["Chris", "Bob", "Jim"];</p>
    <p class="code">let myNumberArray = [10, 15, 40];</p>
    <p>
      Once these arrays are defined, you can access each value by their location
      within the array.
    </p>
    <p class="code">myNameArray[0];</p>
    <p class="code">myNumberArray[2];</p>

    <p>Should return "chris" and 40.</p>
    <p>
      The square brackets specify an index value corresponding to the position
      of the value you want returned.
    </p>
    <h4>Objects</h4>
    <p>
      In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life
      object. You can have an object that represents a box and contains
      information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an
      object that represents a person, and contains data about their name,
      height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and
      more.
    </p>
    <p class="code">let dog = { name: "Spot", breed: "Dalmatian" };</p>
    <p>
      To retrieve the information stored in the object, you can use the
      following syntax:
    </p>
    <p class="code">dog.name;</p>
    <h4>Dynamic typing</h4>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike
      some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable
      will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in
      quotes, the browser treats the variable as a string:
    </p>
    <p class="code">let myNumber = "500";</p>
    <p>This is a string.</p>
    <p class="code">myNumber = 500;</p>
    <p></p>
    This is a number.
    <h4></h4>
    <p>
      As well as variables, you can declare constants. These are like variables,
      except that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>you must initialize them when you declare them</li>
      <li>you can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="code">const myName;</p>
    <p>Returns the error:</p>
    <p class="error">
      Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration (at
      script.js:1:7)
    </p>
    <p class="code">const myName = "Michael";</p>
    <p>
      Note that although a constant in JavaScript must always name the same
      value, you can change the content of the value that it names. This isn't a
      useful distinction for simple types like numbers or booleans, but consider
      an object:
    </p>
    <p class="code">const bird = { species: "Kestrel" };</p>
    <p class="code">console.log(bird.species);</p>
    <p class="console">Kestral</p>
    <p>
      You can update, add, or remove properties of an object declared using
      const, because even though the content of the object has changed, the
      constant is still pointing to the same object:
    </p>
    <p class="code">bird.species = "Striated Caracara";</p>
    <p class="code">console.log(bird.species);</p>
    <p class="console">Striated Caracara</p>
  </body>
</html>
